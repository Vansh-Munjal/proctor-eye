ðŸ”¹ OpenCV (cv2)
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a powerful library used for image and video processing. 
It allows you to:
Access webcam
Detect faces, edges, colors, motion
Display and manipulate images
In this code: You use it for capturing video (VideoCapture), converting color (cvtColor), and displaying output (imshow).

ðŸ”¹ MediaPipe
MediaPipe is a framework by Google for building ML pipelines for perception tasks like:
Face detection
Hand/pose tracking
Gaze estimation
Object detection
In this code: You're using FaceMesh, which detects 468 facial landmarks, including eyes, lips, nose, and iris position (used for gaze).
FaceMesh(refine_landmarks=True): Creates a face mesh model that also detects iris points
